  summary: >
    I am keen to deepen my knowledge in politics, policy and compliance to help constructing bridges to overcome the digital divide in the new age of information. After my PhD studies, I joined the European Data Protection Supervisor through the European Commission’s bluebook trainee scheme. After this experience, I want to continue to shape how information technology is used in Europe.
