## Arrive by Aeroplane :airplane:

Brussels has two airports. In the best case, you arrived at *Brussels Zaventem* (also called *Brussels National*, code BRU). If so, you have two options.

- The :bus: bus 12 or 21 to *Brussels City* leaves every quarter of an hour. You can buy a ticket for 4,50€ at the ticket machine.  Unless you want to go first to the EU quarter (*Place Luxembourg*) or save money, consider to leave the bus at *Da Vinci* to walk over to the train station  *Bordet* and take one of the trains to *Germoir* (e.g. S4, S5, S9).
- You can also take one of the trains from the Airport to Place Luxembourg. This is with 9,00€ more expensive, but can be faster. From Place Luxembourg, there are trains and buses to *Germoir*.

From *Germoir*, it is only few minutes to walk.

## Arrive by Train :bullettrain_side:

Most international trains arrive at *Brussels Midi* (also called Brussels Zuid for South). There is a :tram: tram line 81 to *Montgomery*. Leave at the stop *Levure* and walk a short distance.

## Arrive by Bike :bike:

Take your bike in the train and proceed as explained above. :wink:

## Arrive by App :iphone:

The app [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/) covers most public transportation means in Brussels, but requires Internet. Without Internet, [Osmand](https://osmand.net/) has offline-routing, but does not consider public transportation.
