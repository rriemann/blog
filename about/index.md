> *humanist, moralist, physicist, and cosmopolitan from Berlin*

During my studies, I became knowledgeable and passionate about open source and free software, cryptography, data protection, big data analysis, modern web development (Fullstack), and peer-to-peer technology such as BitTorrent or Blockchain/Bitcoin.

After my PhD studies, I joined the IT Policy team of the *European Data Protection Supervisor* (EDPS). Check out [my résumé](../resume.md) for more information.

In my spare time, I like to go dancing Swing, to sing in a choir and play guitar. I spend a considerable amount of time to learn more about free software and improve free software. I am a fan of Couchsurfing and of
a united Europe.
